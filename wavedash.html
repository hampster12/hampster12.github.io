                    Our group was tasked with creating a game with the theme retro future. Our group immediately decided we wanted the game to move to a beat and what better place than space? With that we wanted to keep it kind of classic by making it all 8-bit and having super chill, rhythmic beats. Our group was made up of three people - Jacob, our developer, Christa, our developer/visual designer, and me, our UX/visual designer. All three of us were friends before (and after) this project but this was the first project we worked together on.

                    We all worked together to create a paper prototype. We utilized papers and taped moving items to small wood dowels.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the paper prototype was completed to our satisfacion, we started working on the actual game. I made majority of the assets (the planets, spaceship, cassettes, iPod shuffles, the shield, and the boombox) along with all the backgrounds while Christa made the rest of the assets (AirPods, microphone, vinyls, the bad DJs, and the player) and assisted Jacob with coding the game.

                    We each choose two songs to include in the game. For each song we chose, we designed the structure of those levels (which items came down, when they came down, and where they came down). Jacob then took that information and entered it into the game.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the process, I updated the website weekly. I also wrote a documentation log each week that also went on the website.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the project was completed, I made our final trailer and then posted it on Youtube so we could present it to our class.

                    We had made a completed game made in Unity, a website documenting our process, and a video trailer at the end of this project.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>reflection</b><br>
                    From this project I learned how hard it actually is to make and scale pixel art. I enjoyed working with friends and found it to be an interesting dynamic - no one wanted to dominate the project and we all trusted each other to pull through with their part of the project.
